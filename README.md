# Rooty

Rooty is a freelance marketplace app designed and developed by students at BCIT as part of an interdisciplinary project (IDSP). Rooty helps BCIT students sell or barter their services to other students, with the goal of improving their experience and building their portfolios. With Rooty, you can post a listing of something you'd like to help someone with, and browse until you find something suitable for you. Simply send a message through the app to get started.

Rooty was developed by a team of students from the Full-Stack Web Development and Design and Development programs, as a mobile freelance marketplace for BCIT studnets to offer thier interdisciplinary skillsets to other BCIT studnets.
